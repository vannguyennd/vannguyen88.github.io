I am Van Nguyen, a postdoctoral research fellow at Monash University in Australia, in the Department of Software Systems & Cybersecurity. Additionally, I am an Affiliate at CSIRO’s Data61, Australia. I completed my PhD in Computer Science at Monash University in 2021 with the thesis "Deep Learning for Software Security". That same year, I was recognised as a global talent through Australia’s Global Talent Independent Program (GTI).

I have around five years of experience in computer science, data science, cybersecurity, and software engineering. My current work and research focus on advancing machine learning and deep learning approaches to solve topical problems in network and software security, including out-of-distribution code identification, robust software vulnerability detection and explanation, transparent and reliable automated vulnerability repair, and enhancing large language models (LLMs) for secure code data generation, aiming for safer and more reliable software development processes and broader security systems. My long-term research goal is to advance AI systems to perform complex human learning, explanation, and reasoning, enabling more intelligent, adaptive, and efficient solutions.

Alongside my expertise in the theories and methodologies of computer science, data science, cybersecurity, and software engineering, I have solid programming and technical skills, with proficiency in Python and a variety of libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Hugging Face for data analysis and implementing machine learning, deep learning, and large language models. I am also experienced in SQL, C/C++, R, Linux, and CUDA.

### News 

I am excited to share that, with the support of Monash University, my proposal titled "Robust and Adaptive AI-driven Solutions for Software Development and Quality Assurance" has been submitted to the Discovery Early Career Researcher Award (DECRA) 2026.

I am delighted to announce that my paper, "AI2TALE: An Innovative Information Theory-based Approach for Learning to Localize Phishing Attacks", has been accepted at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR 2025, Rank: A*).
